Aerial Object Detection from ground-based imagery is a critical task with diverse applications spanning surveillance, urban planning, agriculture, and disaster response. This project presents an implementation utilizing deep learning techniques to detect objects in aerial images captured from ground level cameras. Leveraging TensorFlow and OpenCV libraries, the system detects objects with high accuracy, providing a valuable tool for various real-world scenarios. The project's modular design allows for easy customization and experimentation with different models and parameters, empowering users to adapt the system to their specific requirements. With this project, we aim to contribute to the advancement of computer vision techniques for aerial object detection, facilitating improved decision-making and analysis in a wide range of domains.
